        <center><b><u><h2>Iringole Bhagavathy Temple</h2></u></b></center>
        <p>Iringole Kavu is a forest temple dedicated to Goddess Durga, situated in Kunnathunad Taluk of Ernakulam district, 2.5 km from Perumbavoor. This is one of the 108 Durga Temples in Kerala believed to have been consecrated by Lord Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Lord Vishnu.


This temple is located in the village 'Pattal' 35 kilometers away from Kochi, 8 kilometres away from Perumbavoor, and 20 kilometres away from Kothamangalam[1]

Near iringole kavu there is a school called Government Vocational Higher Secondary School also called "Iringole School" by residents of Iringole. There's a "mana", which is nearer to the temple, that is a historical place. Now it is kept as a tourist spot.



Kansa imprisoned Devaki and Vasudevar due to the fear that their eighth son Krishna who is to be born soon would be his terminator from the earth. In fear and fury Kansa decided to kill their all sons. Vasudevar planned to save his eighth son from the danger at any cost. The parents shifted baby Krishna to Vrindavan soon after he was born and placed another girl baby (an incarnation of the goddess Yoga-Nidra or Maya) in the cradle. Kansa decided to kill the girl baby too, despite realising she was not the eight son of Vasudevar. He lifted the baby furiously above his head, but miraculously the baby became a supernatural power and remained in the atmosphere as 'IRRINNOLE'. Later this area was named as IRINGOLE. It is believed that the gods and goddesses surrounded the power in the forms of trees and plants. And later it is developed into a beautiful thick forest. It is owned by Naganchery Mana. now run by Travancore Devaswom.</p>
